# Glucoduino Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Application

This application connects to an Arduino running the [Glucoduino](https://github.com/bentrevett/Glucoduino) code adapted for the RedBearLab BLE Shield. 

It requires [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

This will not work on the AVD emulator, as it does not support Bluetooth connection.
